## 🚀 About The Project

This project was developed as a **Frontend Engineering assignment** at **INPT (Institut National des Postes et Télécommunications)**.

The goal was to move beyond static HTML/CSS and create a dynamic, user-centric web application using **Vanilla JavaScript** to handle state, DOM manipulation, and interactive logic without relying on external frameworks.

### Key Features:

* **🇲🇦 The "Cloud Kitchen" Concept:** Designed as a digital-first brand for the Moroccan market.
* **🛠️ Interactive Burger Maker:** A complex DOM manipulation feature allowing users to build a burger step-by-step (Bun -> Meat -> Veggies -> Cheese -> Sauce). The visual stack updates in real-time!
* **🛒 Dynamic Cart System:** Items are tracked, prices calculated, and the cart counter updates instantly.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Custom CSS media queries ensure the site looks tasty on mobile and desktop.
* **✨ Modern UI/UX:** Glassmorphism elements, smooth transitions, and a vibrant color palette (`#F94600` Orange & Dark Grey).
